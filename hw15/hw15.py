    ----------
    model: str
        The model/name/vendor of the router
    num_of_ports: int

    Methods
    -------
    add_ipv4(ip, interface)
        Assigns the ip address to the interface. Default mask is /32.
    show_ip_table(self)
        Prints the IP table line by line.
    remove_ipv4(self, ip)
        Removes the IPv4 address from IP table. Default mask is /32.
    add_route(self, destination, next_hop)
        Adds route to the IP route table. Default mask is /32.
    remove_route(self, destination)
        Removes the route to the destination from the IP route table. Default mask is /32.
